# Traffic light for strollers

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

When parents reach a zebra crossing, they have to wait for the traffic light to turn red. Some have a button to accelerate the movement but the parents might be overwhelmed with some baby staff to do. A camera could recognize the strollers and allow for a faster red light if traffic allows.  
This will help parent to manage their stress and ensure higher security level on the road limiting jaywalking and other offences. It will also control drivers who are often tempted to pass even with a stroller on their way. 
Finally, it is a step forward to an intelligent city.


## Background

*I just had a child and waiting under the sun can be disturbing especially in Singapore. 
* parents stress / annoyement resulting in risk taking behaviour.
* waiting for no reason : creating large concentration of people favourable to Covid development.


## How is it used?

The incoming cars should be counted withing a large distance as traffic condition to determine when its acceptable to stop the traffic. When strollers are  identified when in waiting area (next to the zebra), the decision should be make whether it is necessary to bring the light to the red or increase crossing time.


## Data sources and AI methods
the traffic and strollers should be identified live. regarding the traffic, a larger database should be available in many countries.


## Challenges

Perhaps privacy would be an issue

## What next?

We could develop the system for seniors, wheelchairs and blind people. If a child is running around on the zebra, the red light could stay on longer.
