# Traffic light for strollers

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

When parents reach a zebra crossing, they have to wait for the traffic light to turn red. Some have a botom to accelerate the movement but the parents might be overwhelmed with some baby staff to do. A camera could recognize the strollers and allow for a faster red light if traffic allows.  


## Background

I just had a child and waiting under the sun can be disturbing especially in Singapore. Plus the child screaming for food and waiting at the traffic light while there are no cars can be annoying too and some parents might take a risky option.


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* sunburns on the child.
* parents stress / annoyement resulting in risk takiing behavior.
* waiting for no reason : creating large concentration of people favorable to Covid development.


## How is it used?

The incoming cars should be counted withing a large distance as traffic condition to determine when its acceptable to stop the traffic. When strollers are  identified when in waiting area (next to the zebra), the decision should be make wheather it is necessary to brig the light to the red or increase crossing time.


## Data sources and AI methods
the traffic and strollers should be identified live. regarding the traffic, a larger database should be avalaible in many countries.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

We could developpe the system for seniors, wheelchaires and blind people. If a child is runing around on the zebra, the red light could stay on longer.
